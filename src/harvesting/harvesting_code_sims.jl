Harvesting simulations 
This script shows how to
- initialize the BEFWm with a food web and your choice of parameters (S, C and Z)
- run a burn-in to remove structurally doomed species (to avoid detecting them as false secondary extinctions) and achieve equilibrium dynamics - burnin runs for 50 years
- target a species or a group of species for harvesting at a given rate (e.g. % removal of biomass)
- run the model for 10 years 
- detect effects of harvesting (changes in total biomass, persistence, temporal stability and trophic structure)

Step 1: Import some functions that we've made earlier
These functions allow you to use the temperature scaled version of the BEFW which is resolved in real time
=#
include("masters tutorials/utils harvesting.jl") # use include to add these pre-made functions

#=
Step 2: Generate a list of networks
We start by creating a food web using the niche model using a set of S and C values
=#
S = [20, 50, 100] # number of species
con = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] # connectance
nrep = 10 # number of replicates

networks = []

for s in S
    for c in con
        for r in 1:nrep
            A_bool = EcologicalNetworks.nichemodel(s, c) # use niche model to generate network
            A = adjacency(A_bool)
            A = Int.(A) # Convert the unipartiteNetwork into a matrix of 1s and 0s
            push!(networks, A)
            println("$s _ $c _ $r")
        end
    end
end

Step 3: Make data table
Lists our simulation parameters (z and harvesting target) 
=#

target_harvest = [:IQR, :median, :no_fishing_y, :no_fishing_m]
years = 10 # fix the number of years over which harvesting events occur

            input_tmp = (frequency = frequency, rate = rate, sims = sims)
        end
        for a in networks
            input_tmp = (Z = z, target = t, A = a, frequency = frequency, rate = rate, sims = sims)
