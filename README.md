# VS-code-for-Julia
This repository provides a tutorial for using Julia in the Visual Studio Code by Chris Griffiths, Eva Delmas and Andrew Beckerman. 

The tutorial takes the form of 4 documents (available as .html and .pdf files - see `docs`) with the following aims:
  1. Getting started - instructions on how to install and run Julia in VS Code, includes details on Julia's package manager
  2. Basic Julia commands - covers data manipulation, loops and functions and plotting in Julia 
  3. Differential Equations in Julia - introduces the 'DifferentialEquations.jl' package and provides a working food web example
  4. Intro to BioEnergeticFoodWebs - introduces the 'BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl' package and demonstrates how it can be used to simulate biomass dynamics 

The idea is that user downloads the documents and works through them sequentially. Each tutorial should be fully reproducible. 

The tutorials are explicitly designed for new Julia users. They cover a range of topics including working with Julia's package manager, manipulating data, functions and loops, plotting and running differential equations. As a group, we use Julia for all of these tasks as well as running the BioEnergetic Food Web model. 

Enjoy!
