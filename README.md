# VS-code-for-Julia
This repository provides tutorials for using Julia and the BioEnergetic Food Web (BEFW) model in Visual Studio Code by Chris Griffiths, Eva Delmas and Andrew Beckerman. 

The tutorial takes the form of several documents (see `doc`) with the following aims:
  1. GettingStarted - instructions on how to install and run Julia in VS Code, includes details on Julia's package manager
  2. BasicCommands - covers data manipulation, loops and functions and plotting in Julia 
  3. DiffEqs - introduces the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package and provides a working food web example
  4. BioEnergeticFoodWebs - introduces the `BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl` package and demonstrates how it can be used to simulate biomass dynamics 
  5. FunctionalResponse - explains the functional response and how it can be used/manipulated in the BEFW model
  6. TemperatureEffects - details the scaling of biological rates with mass and temperature

The idea is that user downloads the documents and works through them sequentially. Each tutorial **should** be fully reproducible. We recommend working through the .html files but .pdf files are also provided. 

The tutorials are explicitly designed for new Julia users. They cover a range of topics including working with Julia's package manager, manipulating data, functions and loops, plotting, and running factorial experiments. As a group, we use Julia for all of these tasks as well as running the BEFW model. 

Enjoy!
